# week 6
hours spend: about 15h <br/>
<br/>

Thanks for giving me the project written in english for the second peer review, that made my life easier :) <br/>
<br/>
I created a ```menu.py``` file with pygame menu which will ask for user input (instead of terminal as it was before). Also went through peer review comments, which were really useful, and changed a couple of things in my code (comments, line spaces etc). <br/>
<br/>
The project is not complete yet but it will be next week (I am aware of the deadline). Also all the documentation will be written. The least complete is user giude so far - I have notes, have to put it into the sentences and make a document out of it. <br/>
In general, the ```GenerateMaze``` and ```FindSolution classes``` work well. I have to work on the pygame window and menu, other than that there probably will be no changes in the main functionality and algorithms. Function ```maze_dimentions()``` returns width and height of the maze required by  ```GenerateMaze``` class.
