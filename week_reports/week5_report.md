# week 5
hours spent: 15h <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This week I updated testing and implementation documents. To be honest, I didn’t work much on my code because I’m travelling but I’ll look into it more next week. <br/>
<br/>
I went through the assigned peer review code and made a review. It was pretty annoying at first because the whole thing is in Finnish, so as the very first thing I copied and pasted the comments from the code to google translate. That helped me a lot to understand the code. (not gonna lie, would be so much easier if it was actually written in English. But reviewing Finnish project is also possible). <br/>
<br/>
Next week I have to fix recursion error in my code and write more detailed information in the documentation files. <br/>
