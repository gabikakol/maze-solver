# week4
hours spent: about 20h <br/>
<br/>
This week I divided the classes of the program into three separate files: generate_maze.py, find_solution.py, and main.py.  I also made testing files for those classes (test_name of the class in snake case.py). Since I code in Python, I used unittest. Other than that, there were not many changes in the main code. There is still one bug that I have to deal with next week - maximum recursion depth gets exceeded in some cases (and I don't know how to solve the problem (yet)).<br/>
Files for testing and implementation ducuments are created in the folder documentation. Text and information will be added there next week.
