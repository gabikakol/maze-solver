# week4
hours spent: about 20h <br/>
<br/>
This week I divided the classes of the program into three separate files. I also made testing files for those classes. Other than that, there were not many changes in the main code. There is still one bag that I have to deal with next week. <br/>
Files for testing and implementation ducuments are created in the folder [documentation](documentation).
