# week 1
Programme: Bachelor in Science <br/>
Language: english (Python) <br/>
<br/>
Hours spent: ~ 10h  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This week I read the course page and was trying to figure out how this course works. Also created the GitHub repository and the Labtool account. I chose the topic of the project (which took me a while) and the language - Python. I had no clue what I wanted to do for this course, so I read the ideas from the course page and did some google research. I familiarized myself with the chosen topic, made a general plan and wrote the project specification. In the meantime, I also changed my mind about which algorithms I'll be using so I had to make a lot of updates and changes in the documentation. <br/>
<br/>
The unclear part was actualy the course page, I think it should not say that the english version is not up to date if the course is offered in english (although I used google translate to translate the finnish page so it's alright now). <br/>
<br/>
What next? Start coding :)
